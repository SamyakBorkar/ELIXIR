## 🔮 What in the Alchemist's name is this?

Welcome to my personal **Grimoire of Code**. This is where I document my journey into the purple abyss of **Elixir**.

I am abandoning the land of Mutable State to enter the holy realm of **Immutability**. Here lies my practice code, broken scripts, half-baked GenServers, and eventually, the secrets to building fault-tolerant systems that simply *refuse to die*.

## 🧬 The Mutation (Learning Roadmap)

- [x] **Baby Steps:** `IO.puts "Hello World"` (I felt the power).
- [ ] **The Pipe Dream:** Abusing `|>` until my fingers bleed.
- [ ] **Pattern Matching:** The glorious destructuring of data.
- [ ] **Recursion:** To understand recursion, one must first understand recursion.
- [ ] **OTP:** The *Open Telecom Platform* (The big guns).
- [ ] **Phoenix:** Rising from the ashes of my HTTP requests.

## 📂 The Grimoire Structure

Here is how I organize my chaotic experiments:

| Directory | Contents | Danger Level |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `/basics` | Primitive types, atoms, lists, and tuition fees. | 🟢 Safe |
| `/kata` | Algorithmic mental gymnastics. | 🟡 Sweat |
| `/otp_playground` | GenServers, Supervisors, and Agents. | 🔴 Explosive |
| `/projects` | Actual apps (maybe a chat app, because classic). | 🟣 Magic |

## ⚡ The Code of Truth

If you aren't using the **Pipe Operator**, are you even living?

```elixir
"messy_data"
|> String.upcase()
|> String.reverse()
|> TheAlchemist.transmute()
|> IO.inspect(label: "✨ PURE GOLD ✨")
